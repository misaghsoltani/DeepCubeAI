# Repository for [DeepCubeAI](https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/2024/papers/Paper225.html) 

This repository contains the code and materials for the paper [Learning Discrete World Models for Heuristic Search](https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/2024/papers/Paper225.html)

*Note: This README is being updated and will soon contain more details.*

## Getting Started

To run the code, please follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Run the setup script by executing `./setup.sh`

## Running the Code and Reproducing Results

The `reproduce_results` folder contains scripts to run the code. To run different stages of the code and reproduce the results in the paper, please use the corresponding `.sh` files in the `reproduce_results` folder. The code should be run in the order given by the commands inside `.sh` files.

Additionally, if you want to run the code on a machine with SLURM scheduler, you can use the job submission files in the `job_submissions` folder.
